# Breakout SlimeVR
This PCB design is intended as the easiest DIY SlimeVR pcb. It is a simple two
layer PCB, and should make assembling SlimeVR significantly easier than using a
protoboard.

**NOTE: This board is not yet finished, and has only been tested on BNOs and MPUs.**
You may use it as a reference or starting point, but use it at your own risk ;)
